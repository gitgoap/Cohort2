1. Don't wait for the issues to be assigned, solve it and raise a PR until the issue is hard. (hARSHIL J.) said if you feel you may waste time if the issue don't get accepted then wait for it to get assigned.

2. "Quick Fix" tag in Github: It shows the first correct PR is merged first, it's mostly for a very easy issue (one-line code fix). 

3. While raising a PR mention issue it solves as: Mention #issuenumber in the main description not in commmit message Eg-#1907 Github automatically link #1907 with the issue present in the repo.

4. Commit can be done on the PR even after that PR is raised.

5. To work on multiple issues in a repo at the same time, branching is done.

```markdown

| -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Row 1    |
| Row 2    | Row 2    |
